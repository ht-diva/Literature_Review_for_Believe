## AIM ##
The objective of this work is to develop a standardized literature table to evaluate whether the cis-protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) signals identified in the INTERVAL-CHRIS meta-analysis represent novel discoveries. To achieve this, we focus on four of the largest European pQTL studies in the literature, all of which utilized the Somalogic proteomic platform -the same platform used in our analysis-.

- Sun et al., 2018 (DOI: 10.1038/s41586-018-0175-2)
- Pietzner et al., 2021 (DOI: 10.1126/science.abj1541)
- Ferkingstad et al., 2021 (DOI: 10.1038/s41588-021-00978-w)
- Zhang et al., 2022 (DOI: 10.1038/s41588-022-01051-w)

Additionally, we included the Sun et al. 2023 UK Biobank study (DOI: 10.1038/s41586-023-06592-6), which employed the Olink proteomic platform and represents the largest pQTL study conducted to date in a European population (54,219 individuals and 2,923 protein targets). Although this study used a different proteomic technology, it presents an important opportunity to compare and cross-validate pQTL signals across distinct platforms.

We also aim to apply the same approach for the Believe study by including a non-European population to ensure a broader spectrum for determining whether a signal is true or not. As a starting point, we have decided to include the ARIC study, which focuses on the African-American population ()
